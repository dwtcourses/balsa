## Introduction

Balsa is an open source knowledge management platform that has an aim to meet the most demanding privacy and security standards. Balsa centralizes your company documents, helping you collaborate and get organized using a single, privacy-focusing service.

Balsa helps diversified, team-based organizations collaborate and share knowledge seamlessly and securely. It centralizes internal knowledge and workflow, without worrying about security and data privacy. With Balsa, you can get up and start collaborating quickly with the help of integrations and underlying robust, secure infrastructure. 

Use Balsa to: 

* Empower your colleagues and help them document faster - with less email, and fewer meetings.
* Connect people with company’s private knowledge in a trusted workplace
* Customize, white label, and adopt according to your requirements

Balsa is “work processing” made simple and secure.

## Features

We realize you need a modern, fast, plugin based knowledge management platform that you can trust. Balsa centralizes your company documents, helping you collaborate and get organized using a single, privacy-focusing service.

* **Knowledgebase & documents:** Balsa has a company-wide knowledgebase that you can store and share your most important documents within the company, without sharing it with 3rd parties, using highest security standards.

* **Tasks & projects:** From simple listviews to tasks, Balsa provides you the simplest yet thought out solution your project teams across the company can use.

* **Tables (and soon spreadsheets):** Keeping a list of your todo items, organizing your client list or just maintain your HR resources is a breeze with Balsa. Just start with a blank page, add collaborators and go.

* **Team management:** Balsa has 2-level user management role system where you can define admins or users, each having different permissions. 

## Installation

Balsa installer assumes it is running on a vanilla Ubuntu/CentOS/RHEL Linux without any services listening on port 80 or 443 (which should also be open to incoming traffic). Once run, it takes care of every configuration and doesn't require any additional, manual intervention.

To deploy Balsa, download the latest release and run: ```sudo ./install.sh```.  

## Roadmap

What we would like to add on top of Balsa are as follows: 

- A full fledged database
- Calendar integration 
- Gantt chart
- Spell checker
- ENEX dump (for Evernote migration)
- Web clipper (not very soon)
- Better offline work
