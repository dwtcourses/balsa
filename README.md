## Introduction

Balsa is an open source knowledge management platform that has an aim to meet the most demanding privacy and security standards. Balsa centralizes your company documents, helping you collaborate and get organized using a single, privacy-focusing service.

Balsa helps diversified, team-based organizations collaborate and share knowledge seamlessly and securely. It centralizes internal knowledge and workflow, without worrying about security and data privacy. With Balsa, you can get up and start collaborating quickly with the help of integrations and underlying robust, secure infrastructure. 

Use Balsa to: 

* Empower your colleagues and help them document faster - with less email, and fewer meetings.
* Connect people with company’s private knowledge in a trusted workplace
* Customize, white label, and adopt according to your requirements

Balsa is “work processing” made simple and secure.

## Installation

Balsa installer assumes it is running on a vanilla Ubuntu/CentOS/RHEL Linux without any services listening on port 80 or 443 (which should also be open to incoming traffic). Once run, it takes care of every configuration and doesn't require any additional, manual intervention.

To deploy Balsa, download the latest release and run: ```sudo ./install.sh```.  

## Roadmap

What we would like to add on top of Balsa are as follows: 

- A database
- Calendar integration 
- Gantt chart
- Spell checker
- ENEX dump (for Evernote migration)
- Web clipper (not very soon)
- Better offline work
